# AssemblyAI Integration — Coding Agent Instructions

**Standing, and not ours.** This is AssemblyAI's own guidance for coding
agents, kept verbatim as a reference about their API. It is not a design and
not a plan: TRANSCRIPTS.md is the design, and where the two differ about what
this project is doing, TRANSCRIPTS.md wins.

It earns its place because memory is not evidence about this API. It corrected
two things in phase 1 that had type-checked and read fine and would have failed
at runtime — `speech_model` is deprecated in favour of the `speech_models`
fallback array, and `utterances` comes back only when diarisation is on, which
we never ask for. Read § *4. API Overview*, § *5. `speech_models` Semantics*
and § *15. Quick-Reference Gotchas* before touching
`server/src/transcription.ts`.

Two cautions about reading it. Its § *0. Operating Rules* describe a
discovery-and-approval workflow for a project that has not decided anything
yet; this one has, in TRANSCRIPTS.md, so those rules do not apply here. And it
is a snapshot of a moving API — `https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/llms.txt` is
the live version and the thing to fetch when it matters.

Everything below this line is theirs.

---

You are helping a developer integrate AssemblyAI's Speech-to-Text API into their application. Your job is to understand their context through discovery, produce a concrete implementation plan, get their approval, and then write correct, production-ready code.

This is a public API. The developer creates their own key at [assemblyai.com/dashboard/api-keys](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/api-keys).

**Official documentation.** Two ways to wire your coding agent up to live docs (both recommended — they layer):

1. **Project instructions** (every prompt): add to `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, or equivalent:

   ```
   Always fetch https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/llms.txt before writing AssemblyAI code.
   The API has changed — do not rely on memorized parameter names.
   ```

   `llms.txt` is the structured index. For full content use `llms-full.txt`; narrow with `?lang=python` or `?lang=typescript`, or add `?excludeSpec=true` to skip the API spec.

2. **Docs MCP server** (on-demand lookups): `https://mcp.assemblyai.com/docs` — Streamable HTTP transport. Provides `search_docs`, `get_pages`, `list_sections`, `get_api_reference`.

   ```bash
   # Claude Code
   claude mcp add assemblyai-docs --transport http https://mcp.assemblyai.com/docs
   ```

   See the [Coding agent prompts](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/coding-agent-prompts) page for Cursor and other clients.

## 0. Operating Rules

1. **Discovery first, code later.** Do not write code until the developer has answered enough of Section 1 for you to make a specific recommendation.
2. **One question per message.** Never batch discovery questions. Wait for an answer before asking the next one.
3. **Plan before you build.** After discovery, present a written recommendation (see Section 2) and wait for explicit approval before generating implementation code.
4. **Prefer the official SDKs.** Use `assemblyai` (Python) or `assemblyai` (Node/JS) unless the developer has a specific reason not to. The SDKs handle polling, uploads, WebSocket lifecycle, and session termination correctly — which is where most hand-rolled integrations fail.
5. **Never expose the API key in client-side code.** For browser or mobile realtime, always mint a temporary token server-side. For pre-recorded, proxy uploads and submissions through your server.
6. **Authorization header is the raw key — no `Bearer` prefix.** This trips up everyone. **One exception:** the Voice Agent API (Section 10) requires `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`. Don't generalize either rule across products.
7. **Set `speech_models` explicitly on pre-recorded requests.** It's *optional* — if omitted, the API defaults to `["universal-3-pro", "universal-2"]` — so to run the current flagship you must pass it yourself: recommended `["universal-3-5-pro", "universal-2"]` (see Section 5 for semantics). `universal-3-5-pro` is the current flagship; `universal-2` is the broadly-available fallback. (On *realtime*, the singular `speech_model` **is** required.)
8. **Always terminate realtime sessions explicitly.** An abandoned WebSocket keeps accruing charges until the 3-hour cap.
9. **Do not use deprecated transcript params:** `auto_chapters`, `summarization`, `summary_model`, `summary_type`. Use LLM Gateway instead (Section 8).
10. **If the developer's answers are inconsistent, stop and surface the conflict.** Example conflicts: "browser-only, no backend" + "realtime"; "phone call audio" + "upload a file"; "real-time" + "need speaker diarization with full names." Don't paper over these — ask.
11. **Be flexible.** If something the developer says doesn't match the shape of the API (e.g., they describe a use case that isn't supported — see Section 13), say so directly and propose the closest supported alternative.
12. **Verify parameters against live docs before recommending.** This file is a snapshot — features move between beta and GA, model-specific behaviors change, and new knobs ship regularly. Before posting the Section 2 recommendation, confirm each parameter you plan to use is supported for the chosen **mode** (pre-recorded vs realtime) *and* **model** (U3.5 Pro, U2, U3 Pro realtime, Universal-streaming). Do not assume a pre-recorded flag works on realtime, or that a parameter supported on U2 still behaves the same on U3 Pro. Pull the current reference rather than memorizing. Primary sources, in order of preference:
    - `https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/llms-full.txt` — the canonical machine-readable reference
    - Per-mode docs: `/docs/pre-recorded-audio/*` (pre-recorded) and `/docs/streaming/*` (realtime), including the model-specific overview page (e.g.,`/docs/streaming/select-the-speech-model`) which lists *exactly* which parameters are honored/ignored by that model
    - The OpenAPI-backed API reference at `/docs/api-reference/*` for request/response schemas
    - For LLM Gateway: `/docs/llm-gateway/quickstart` lists the current valid `model` strings — don't guess short names like `claude-sonnet-4`
  If a flag you remembered isn't in the current docs (or is marked beta / deprecated / ignored for the chosen model), flag it in the recommendation's "Open questions / assumptions" block and ask the developer before proceeding.

---

## 1. Discovery Questions

Ask these **one at a time**, in order. Skip any question already answered in the conversation. Adapt wording to sound natural, but cover the substance of each.

1. **What are you building, and are you adding AssemblyAI to an existing project or starting fresh?** (A short description of the product is usually enough.)
2. **What do you need: pre-recorded transcription, realtime STT, or a managed voice agent?**
   - Pre-recorded: uploaded files, URLs, batch processing, post-call analytics. → Section 6.
   - realtime STT: live transcripts only (you bring your own LLM/TTS). Live captioning, voice-agent STT, meeting notetaking, dictation. → Section 9.
   - Voice Agent API (managed): full-duplex speech-in/speech-out — STT + LLM + TTS + turn detection + tool calling, all in one WebSocket. Right answer when "I want to talk to an AI" is the whole product. → Section 10.
3. **Where is your audio coming from?** (e.g., uploaded files, public URLs, browser microphone, mobile app, Twilio/Telnyx phone numbers, SIP trunks.)
4. **What language and framework are you using?** (e.g., Python + FastAPI, Node + Next.js, Go, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, browser-only, LiveKit, Pipecat, Vapi, Vocode, Retell.)
5. **Do you already have an AssemblyAI API key, or do you need to create one?** (If needed: [assemblyai.com/dashboard/api-keys](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/api-keys).)
6. **Do you have a data residency requirement?** (US vs EU — this changes the base URL.)
7. **Anything beyond a plain transcript?** Don't read off a checklist. Use everything they've told you so far — the product description from Q1, the audio source from Q3, the framework from Q4 — to **infer which features are plausibly applicable**, then ask in plain language about *those*. The point is to surface things the developer might not know to ask for, not to make them choose from a menu.

   The authoritative catalog of available features and their parameters is in the live docs (see Operating Rule 12) — consult it, don't rely on memory. Section 3 of this file is a starting reference, not the final word.

   Calibrate to mode and use case. Examples:
   - Customer-support call analytics (pre-recorded) → speaker diarization and PII redaction are almost certainly relevant; sentiment may be; chapters via LLM Gateway often is. Ask about those, not about live-realtime features.
   - Browser live-captioning (realtime) → ask about multilingual support and domain vocabulary; don't bring up PII redaction or summaries-during-session (neither applies to realtime).
   - Voice agent (realtime) → keyterms prompting and turn-detection tuning matter; speaker diarization usually doesn't.
   - Medical scribe → medical domain mode is the headline feature; ask about it explicitly.

   Don't ask about things the user gets automatically with no toggle (word-level timestamps and confidence on `words[]`, realtime `SpeechStarted` events). Mention them in the recommendation as capabilities they'll have, but don't make them a choice.

   If you're confident from context that a feature is needed (e.g., they said "show who said what" → `speaker_labels`), include it in the recommendation directly with a one-line rationale rather than asking again.

---

## 2. Recommendation Template (after discovery)

Before writing code, post a plan with all of the following. Get explicit approval.

```
## Recommendation

**Use case:** <one-sentence summary of what they're building>
**Mode:** <pre-recorded / realtime / both>
**Region:** <US or EU base URL>

**Model:**
- <model name> — <one-line rationale>
- <fallback model, if applicable>

**Endpoints:**
- <endpoint 1>
- <endpoint 2>

**Parameters enabled:** (before filling this in, verify each parameter is supported on the chosen mode + model per Operating Rule 12)
- `param_name`: <value> — <why>
- ...

**Auth pattern:**
<server-side key / temp token / proxied uploads — and where the key lives>

**Termination & error handling:**
<how realtime sessions are closed; how errors / retries are handled>

**Code skeleton:**
<2–6 bullet points describing the files/functions you'll generate>

**Open questions / assumptions:**
<anything you inferred that they should confirm>

Ready to proceed?
```

If they say yes, write the code. If they push back on any piece, revise the plan — don't just start coding around objections.

---

## 3. Feature Selection Guide (agent reference)

Use this to build the recommendation. Do not dump it on the user.

| Developer need | Parameter / approach |
|---|---|
| Speaker diarization | `speaker_labels: true` (pre-recorded, and realtime on U3.5 Pro — realtime adds a `speaker_label` to each Turn event and a `speaker` to each final word; tune with `max_speakers`, and watch for the late `SpeakerRevision` message that refines earlier turns — see Section 9) |
| Automatic language detection | `language_detection: true` (pre-recorded; **also supported on U3.5 Pro realtime**, where it adds `language_code` + `language_confidence` to Turn events) |
| Specific language | `language_code: "es"` etc. — pre-recorded, **and U3.5 Pro realtime** (steers per-token toward one of 18 languages). On U3.5 Pro, omit it to let the model code-switch natively |
| Multilingual / code-switching | U3.5 Pro handles code-switching across its 18 languages **natively, no config needed** (`speech_models: ["universal-3-5-pro"]` pre-recorded / `speech_model=universal-3-5-pro` realtime) |
| Prompting | `prompt: "..."` — flexible natural-language guidance: describe the audio (domain, scenario, names) and/or steer behavior, e.g. `"Transcribe in Spanish."`, or for code-switching `"Transcribe this. Mixed languages in their own characters."`. `language_code` is just a structured shortcut for the language-steering case. Depth levels (domain / scenario / detailed) in Section 6.2. Pre-recorded and U3.5 Pro realtime (max ~1500 chars on realtime) |
| Domain-specific vocabulary | `keyterms_prompt: [...]` (pre-recorded U3.5 Pro: up to 1,000 phrases, ≤6 words each — caps differ on other models, verify per docs; realtime: up to 100 terms) |
| Medical domain | `domain: "medical-v1"` (pre-recorded *and* realtime; supported languages: en, es, de, fr) |
| PII redaction in text | `redact_pii: true` + `redact_pii_policies: [...]` + optional `redact_pii_sub: "hash" | "entity_name"` (pre-recorded, **and U3.5 Pro realtime** — realtime applies it to final turns only) |
| PII redaction in audio | `redact_pii_audio: true` (pre-recorded only; original file must be ≤1 GB; redacted audio URL is available for 24 h) |
| Background-noise / voice isolation (realtime) | `voice_focus: "near-field" | "far-field"` (U3.5 Pro realtime) + optional `voice_focus_threshold` (0.0–1.0) |
| Per-turn LLM on the live stream | `llm_gateway: <JSON config>` on the realtime connection — runs an LLM Gateway request on each finalized turn (translation, classification, structured extraction) and returns `LLMGatewayResponse` events |
| Chapters or summaries (batch) | Transcribe first, then LLM Gateway (Section 8) |
| Translation / speaker ID / custom formatting (batch) | `speech_understanding: { request: { ... } }` on `/v2/transcript` — Translation (`translation.target_languages` → `translated_texts`), Speaker Identification (`speaker_type: "role" | "name"`, attribute turns to speakers you supply), Custom Formatting (date/phone/email patterns). See [Speech Understanding](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/speech-understanding/translation). For *realtime* translation use `llm_gateway` instead (above) |
| Word timestamps / confidence | Included by default on `words[]` |
| Webhook delivery (skip polling) | `webhook_url: "..."` (Section 7) |
| Single-request short-clip transcription (no polling) | Sync API / `SyncTranscriber` — audio in, transcript out (Section 6.1) |
| Managed voice agent (speech-in / speech-out) | Voice Agent API (Section 10) — one WebSocket, no separate STT/LLM/TTS |
| Custom voice agent (your LLM + TTS) | realtime STT + framework integration (Section 11) |

## 4. API Overview

- **REST base URL (US):** `https://api.assemblyai.com`
- **REST base URL (EU):** `https://api.eu.assemblyai.com`
- **Sync transcription (short clips, single request):** `https://sync.assemblyai.com/transcribe` (Section 6.1)
- **realtime WebSocket (Edge, default):** `wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/ws` — auto-routes to the nearest region (Oregon / Virginia / Ireland) for lowest latency
- **realtime WebSocket (US data residency):** `wss://streaming.us.assemblyai.com/v3/ws` — data pinned to US
- **realtime WebSocket (EU data residency):** `wss://streaming.eu.assemblyai.com/v3/ws` — data pinned to EU
- **LLM Gateway (US):** `https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- **LLM Gateway (EU):** `https://llm-gateway.eu.assemblyai.com/v1/chat/completions` — Claude and Gemini only; OpenAI/Qwen/Kimi are US-only
- **Auth header:** `Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY` (no `Bearer`). Same header is used for REST, realtime WS upgrade, temp-token minting, and LLM Gateway
- **Content type:** `application/json` for submit/poll and LLM Gateway; `application/octet-stream` (raw binary) for `/v2/upload`

Core REST endpoints:
- `POST /v2/upload` — upload a local file (raw binary body, **not multipart**). Returns `{ "upload_url": "..." }`. Max 2.2 GB.
- `POST /v2/transcript` — submit a job. Returns transcript object with `id` and `status: "queued"`. Max 5 GB / 10 hours.
- `GET /v2/transcript/{id}` — poll. Statuses: `queued`, `processing`, `completed`, `error`.

realtime:
- `wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/ws?sample_rate=16000&speech_model=universal-3-5-pro&mode=balanced`
- `GET https://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/token?expires_in_seconds=60` — mint a single-use temp token for browser/mobile clients. Optional `max_session_duration_seconds` (60–10800, defaults to 3 h) caps the downstream session length.

---

## 5. `speech_models` Semantics

`speech_models` on pre-recorded requests is an **ordered fallback list**, not parallel execution. The first model in the array is tried; if it's unavailable (e.g., not yet rolled out to the account, or temporarily unhealthy), the next is used. A single transcript is produced by exactly one model. This is **model-availability** fallback — distinct from U3.5 Pro's internal **language** fallback (below).

Recommended value: `["universal-3-5-pro", "universal-2"]` — tries the current flagship first, falls back to the broadly-available stable model. The parameter is **optional**; if you omit it the API applies its own default of `["universal-3-pro", "universal-2"]`, so set it explicitly to get U3.5 Pro. (The singular `speech_model` request param is deprecated — use the plural `speech_models` array.)

`universal-3-5-pro` natively transcribes **18 languages** with code-switching; for audio in any other language it **automatically falls back to Universal-2** (99 languages total) with no extra configuration. So `["universal-3-5-pro", "universal-2"]` gives you the best model where it's supported and full language coverage everywhere else.

On realtime the parameter is **singular and a different string convention**: `speech_model=universal-3-5-pro` (no array, no fallback list). Pre-recorded takes a plural **array**; realtime takes a singular **string**. This mismatch is the single most common mistake — see the gotchas in Section 15.

---

## 6. Pre-Recorded Quick Start

### SDK (recommended)

**Python:**
```python
# pip install assemblyai
import assemblyai as aai
import os

aai.settings.api_key = os.environ["ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"]

config = aai.TranscriptionConfig(
    speech_models=["universal-3-5-pro", "universal-2"],  # fallback handled by SDK
    speaker_labels=True,
)

transcript = aai.Transcriber(config=config).transcribe("https://assembly.ai/wildfires.mp3")
# Or a local path: .transcribe("./recording.wav")

if transcript.status == aai.TranscriptStatus.error:
    raise RuntimeError(transcript.error)
print(transcript.text)
```

**Node/JS:**
```javascript
// npm install assemblyai
import { AssemblyAI } from 'assemblyai';

const client = new AssemblyAI({ apiKey: process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY });

const transcript = await client.transcripts.transcribe({
  audio: 'https://assembly.ai/wildfires.mp3', // or a local file path / Buffer / stream
  speech_models: ["universal-3-5-pro", "universal-2"],
  speaker_labels: true,
});

if (transcript.status === 'error') throw new Error(transcript.error);
console.log(transcript.text);
```

The SDK handles upload, submit, and polling. You don't need to write the polling loop yourself.

### Raw HTTP (fallback — use only if SDK isn't an option)

**Upload a local file** (raw bytes, not multipart):
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/upload   -H "Authorization: $ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"   --data-binary @recording.wav
# -> { "upload_url": "https://cdn.assemblyai.com/upload/..." }
```

**Submit and poll (Python):**
```python
import os, time, requests

headers = {"authorization": os.environ["ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"]}

submit = requests.post(
    "https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "audio_url": "https://assembly.ai/wildfires.mp3",
        "speech_models": ["universal-3-5-pro", "universal-2"],
        "speaker_labels": True,
    },
)
transcript_id = submit.json()["id"]

while True:
    res = requests.get(
        f"https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript/{transcript_id}",
        headers=headers,
    ).json()
    if res["status"] == "completed":
        print(res["text"]); break
    if res["status"] == "error":
        raise RuntimeError(res["error"])
    time.sleep(3)
```

Common optional params: `speaker_labels`, `language_detection`, `language_code`, `punctuate`, `format_text`, `redact_pii`, `redact_pii_audio`, `keyterms_prompt`, `webhook_url`, `prompt`.

### 6.1 Sync API — short clips, single request (no polling)

For **short audio** where you want the transcript inline, the **sync API** posts the whole file and returns the finished transcript in one round trip — no job id, no `status` polling. It runs `universal-3-5-pro`. Use it for snappy request/response paths (e.g. a voice-agent turn, a short voice note). Use the async `/v2/transcript` flow above instead for long-form audio, public URLs, or the rich audio-intelligence features (speaker labels, chapters, sentiment, PII audio redaction) — **the sync API does not expose those.**

- **Endpoint:** `POST https://sync.assemblyai.com/transcribe` (`multipart/form-data`, model selected by the `X-AAI-Model: universal-3-5-pro` header — the SDK sets it for you).
- **Limits:** 80 ms–120 s, ≤40 MB, 16-bit PCM/WAV, mono or stereo, sample rate ∈ {8000, 16000, 22050, 24000, 32000, 44100, 48000}.
- **Input is a file, not a URL** — a local path, raw `bytes`, or a file object.

**Python SDK (recommended):**
```python
import assemblyai as aai
import os

aai.settings.api_key = os.environ["ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"]

config = aai.SyncTranscriptionConfig(
    model="universal-3-5-pro",                               # the sync model (sent as the X-AAI-Model header)
    prompt="Customer support call about a Best Buy order.",  # contextual, max 4096 chars
    keyterms_prompt=["AssemblyAI", "Best Buy"],              # keyterms, max 2048 chars total
    language_code="en",                                      # ISO 639-1, or a list for multilingual audio
)
result = aai.SyncTranscriber().transcribe("./call.wav", config=config)
print(result.text, result.session_id)
for w in result.words:
    print(w.text, w.start, w.end, w.confidence)  # timings in ms
```

`conversation_context` carries prior turns (oldest first, ≤100 turns / 4096 chars total) so the model keeps continuity and proper-noun spelling across a multi-turn exchange — ideal for voice agents. For **raw PCM** (S16LE) you must set both `sample_rate` and `channels`; WAV reads them from its header.

**Raw HTTP:**
```bash
curl -F 'audio=@call.wav;type=audio/wav'   -F 'config={"prompt":"Support call.","keyterms_prompt":["AssemblyAI"]};type=application/json'   -H "Authorization: $ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"   -H "X-AAI-Model: universal-3-5-pro"   https://sync.assemblyai.com/transcribe
```

Response: `{ text, words:[{text,start,end,confidence}], confidence, audio_duration_ms, session_id, request_time_ms }`. Errors raise `aai.SyncTranscriptError` (raw HTTP returns RFC 9457 problem-details) with a status code, a machine-readable `error_code` (e.g. `audio_too_short`, `audio_too_large`, `capacity_exceeded`, `inference_timeout`), and `retry_after` seconds on 429/503.

**Param-name note:** the sync API uses `keyterms_prompt` for keyterms, same as the other APIs; `prompt` is contextual — same semantics as elsewhere.

### 6.2 Writing a good `prompt` (U3.5 Pro)

`prompt` takes plain, natural-language sentences that describe the audio, and it scales with how much you know. Match the depth to the context you actually have:

| Level | Length | What it contains | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Domain** | 2–5 words | The domain only | `Medical consultation call.` |
| **Scenario** | 5–15 words | What the conversation is about | `Cardiology consultation about chest pain symptoms.` |
| **Detailed** | 20–50 words | Full description — names, products, identifiers | `Cardiology consultation between Dr. Smith and an elderly patient regarding recurring chest pain, ECG results, and a medication adjustment for hypertension.` |

Guidelines:
- Write **plain, complete sentences** that describe the audio.
- Keep it to **one short block of text** — don't pack a list of keywords into the prompt. For lists of exact terms (names, SKUs, jargon) use `keyterms_prompt` instead; the two are complementary.
- The same `prompt` field works on realtime U3.5 Pro (max ~1500 chars) and can additionally steer language/behavior — e.g. `"Transcribe in Spanish."` (Section 9).

This applies to both pre-recorded and realtime U3.5 Pro.

---

## 7. Webhooks (skip polling)

Provide `webhook_url` on submit; AssemblyAI POSTs when the job finishes:

```json
{ "transcript_id": "5552493-16d8-42d8-8feb-c2a16b56f6e8", "status": "completed" }
```

Handler requirements:
- Return 2xx within **10 seconds**. Otherwise retried up to 10 times, 10s apart. 4xx is not retried.
- On receipt, call `GET /v2/transcript/{id}` to fetch the full result — the webhook payload doesn't include it.

Optional custom auth on your webhook: set `webhook_auth_header_name` and `webhook_auth_header_value` when submitting.

**Source IPs** (for allowlists): US `44.238.19.20`, EU `54.220.25.36`.

**Local dev note:** Webhook URLs must be publicly reachable. Use ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel, or similar during development.

---

## 8. LLM Gateway (chapters, summaries, custom analysis)

LLM Gateway replaces both the deprecated transcript params (`auto_chapters`, `summarization`, `summary_model`, `summary_type`) and the legacy **LeMUR** API, which sunset on 2026-03-31. If a developer mentions LeMUR or `transcript_ids`, point them at LLM Gateway and the [migration guide](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/llm-gateway/migration-from-lemur). Workflow:

1. Transcribe normally with `POST /v2/transcript`.
2. Once `status == "completed"`, POST to LLM Gateway with the transcript text (or paragraphs from `GET /v2/transcript/{id}/paragraphs` for chapter-style output):

```bash
POST https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1/chat/completions
Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "Produce a 5-bullet summary of the transcript." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "<transcript.text here>" }
  ],
  "max_tokens": 1000
}
```

Model IDs are exact, versioned strings that change often — **fetch the current list from the [LLM Gateway Overview](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/llm-gateway/overview); don't rely on memorized names** (per Operating Rule 12). They look like `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-5.2`, `gemini-2.5-pro`. A bare family name with no version suffix (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4`) is **not** valid. EU region (`llm-gateway.eu.assemblyai.com`) supports Anthropic and Google only.

Do not submit with `auto_chapters` and `summarization` both enabled — the API rejects it (`Only one of the following models can be enabled at a time: auto_chapters, summarization.`). But the broader rule is simpler: **don't use either.**

---

## 9. realtime — Universal-3-5 Pro

**WebSocket (default, Edge Routing):** `wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/ws?sample_rate=16000&speech_model=universal-3-5-pro&mode=balanced`

For data residency, swap the host: `streaming.us.assemblyai.com` (US-pinned) or `streaming.eu.assemblyai.com` (EU-pinned). The default host auto-routes to the nearest region.

`mode` (`min_latency` / `balanced` / `max_accuracy`) is the primary knob — see [Connection parameters](#connection-parameters) below.

**Audio format:** PCM16 signed little-endian, mono, 16 kHz. Binary WebSocket frames, **50–1000 ms per chunk**, no faster than real-time. Phone audio (`encoding=pcm_mulaw`, `sample_rate=8000`) is sent as-is — don't upsample.

**Auth:**
- Server-side: `Authorization` header on the WS upgrade.
- Browser/mobile: mint a short-lived token server-side and pass it as `?token=<token>` (no Authorization header).

Mint a token:
```bash
curl -s "https://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/token?expires_in_seconds=60"   -H "Authorization: $ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"
# { "token": "..." }
```
`expires_in_seconds` must be 1–600. Tokens are single-use per session.

### Connection parameters

All connection parameters are passed as **query-string params on the WebSocket URL** (or via the SDK's connect/streaming params). Most are **Universal-3-5 Pro only** — don't assume they exist on the older `universal-streaming-*` models. Verify against the [Universal-3.5 Pro Streaming reference](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming-api/universal-3-pro-streaming) (Operating Rule 12) before relying on any of them.

**`mode` is the primary control — set this first.** It's a latency/accuracy preset (`min_latency`, `balanced`, `max_accuracy`) that tunes the model's turn-detection and partial-emission defaults server-side. Picking a mode is usually enough on its own; only touch the advanced turn-detection knobs if you have a specific reason. When omitted, the server applies its own preset.

| Group | Params |
|---|---|
| **Language** | `language_code` — pin one of 18 langs (`en, es, fr, de, it, pt, tr, nl, sv, no, da, fi, hi, vi, ar, he, ja, zh`); omit to code-switch natively. `language_detection=true` — return `language_code` + `language_confidence` on Turn events. |
| **Context / accuracy** | `prompt` — flexible natural-language guidance: describe the audio and/or steer behavior, e.g. `"Transcribe in Spanish."` (max ~1500 chars; depth levels in Section 6.2). `keyterms_prompt` — up to 100 bias terms. `agent_context` — your voice agent's last spoken (TTS) reply, to bias the next turn; updatable mid-stream (max ~1500 chars). `previous_context_n_turns` — advanced conversation carryover (0–100; 0 disables); leave unset normally. |
| **Audio / noise** | `encoding` — `pcm_s16le` (default) or `pcm_mulaw`. `sample_rate` — any int 8000–96000 (default 16000). `voice_focus` — `near-field` / `far-field` background-noise suppression (off by default); `voice_focus_threshold` 0.0–1.0 (requires `voice_focus`). |
| **Turn detection** (advanced; `mode` sets these) | `min_turn_silence` (ms, clamped 50–10000), `max_turn_silence` (ms, default 1000), `vad_threshold` (0.0–1.0), `interruption_delay` (ms, 0–1000; server adds a fixed 256 ms), `continuous_partials` (default `true` — extra partials ~every 3 s during long turns), `include_partial_turns` (default `true`, but `false` when `redact_pii` is on). |
| **Diarization** | `speaker_labels=true` + optional `max_speakers` (1–10). Adds a `speaker_label` to Turn events and a `speaker` to final words; emits a late `SpeakerRevision` message (see below). |
| **Redaction / profanity** | `redact_pii=true` + `redact_pii_policies` + `redact_pii_sub` (`entity_name` / `hash`) — applies to **final turns only**. `filter_profanity`. |
| **Per-turn LLM** | `llm_gateway` — JSON-stringified Chat Completions config run on each finalized turn (translation, classification, extraction); results arrive as `LLMGatewayResponse` events. |
| **Session** | `inactivity_timeout` (5–3600 s; send `KeepAlive` to reset). |

**Not U3.5 Pro knobs:** `format_turns` and `end_of_turn_confidence_threshold` do **not** apply — formatting always tracks `end_of_turn`, and `end_of_turn_confidence` is binary (`1.0` on end-of-turn, `0.0` otherwise). They belong to the older `universal-streaming-*` models.

### Server messages (JSON)

- `Begin` — `{ type, id, expires_at }`
- `SpeechStarted` — `{ type, timestamp, confidence }`. Every `SpeechStarted` is followed by one or more `Turn` messages.
- `Turn` — `{ type, turn_order, end_of_turn, turn_is_formatted, transcript, end_of_turn_confidence, words:[...], utterance }`, plus `speaker_label` (when `speaker_labels` is on) and `language_code` / `language_confidence` (when `language_detection` is on).
  - `end_of_turn: false` → partial; `end_of_turn: true` → finalized and formatted. Always read `transcript` for current text. `utterance` is populated only on end-of-turn messages.
  - Each word is `{ text, start, end, confidence, word_is_final }`, plus `speaker` on final words when diarization is on (may be absent on a word — fall back to the turn-level `speaker_label`).
- `SpeakerRevision` — `{ type, revisions:[{ turn_order, speaker_label, words:[...] }] }`. Diarization only. Emitted at most once, right before `Termination` (after you send `Terminate`), to refine speaker labels on earlier turns. Match each revision by `turn_order` and replace that turn's `speaker_label` / per-word `speaker` — text and timestamps are unchanged. Adds ~400 ms at session close.
- `LLMGatewayResponse` — `{ type, turn_order, transcript, data }` (only when `llm_gateway` is configured; one per finalized turn).
- `Termination` — `{ type, audio_duration_seconds, session_duration_seconds }`

### Client messages

- Binary PCM16 frames — audio.
- `{ "type": "Terminate" }` — graceful end. **Always send this when done.**
- `{ "type": "ForceEndpoint" }` — force current turn to end.
- `{ "type": "KeepAlive" }` — only needed if `inactivity_timeout` is set.
- `{ "type": "UpdateConfiguration", ... }` — adjust mid-session. Updatable fields: `prompt`, `keyterms_prompt`, `agent_context`, `min_turn_silence`, `max_turn_silence`, `continuous_partials`, `vad_threshold`, `interruption_delay`. (For voice agents, push the agent's latest reply into `agent_context` after each agent turn.)

### SDK (recommended)

**Python:**
```python
# pip install "assemblyai>=1.0.0"
import os
from assemblyai.streaming.v3 import (
    StreamingClient,
    StreamingClientOptions,
    StreamingEvents,
    StreamingParameters,
    TurnEvent,
)

def on_turn(_, event: TurnEvent):
    tag = "FINAL" if event.end_of_turn else "partial"
    print(f"{tag}: {event.transcript}")

client = StreamingClient(
    StreamingClientOptions(api_key=os.environ["ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"])
)
client.on(StreamingEvents.Turn, on_turn)
client.connect(StreamingParameters(sample_rate=16000, speech_model="universal-3-5-pro", mode="balanced"))

# Feed 16 kHz mono PCM16 chunks (50–1000ms each) via client.stream(chunk)
# When finished:
client.disconnect(terminate=True)  # sends Terminate and closes cleanly
```

**Node/JS:**
```javascript
// npm install assemblyai
import { AssemblyAI } from 'assemblyai';

const client = new AssemblyAI({ apiKey: process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY });
const rt = client.streaming.transcriber({
  sampleRate: 16000,
  speechModel: 'universal-3-5-pro',
  mode: 'balanced',
});

rt.on('turn', (turn) => {
  const tag = turn.end_of_turn ? 'FINAL' : 'partial';
  console.log(`${tag}: ${turn.transcript}`);
});
rt.on('error', (err) => console.error(err));

await rt.connect();
// rt.sendAudio(pcm16Buffer) for each 50–1000ms chunk
// When done:
await rt.close(); // sends Terminate and closes
```

### Raw WebSocket (fallback)

**Node.js (`ws`):**
```javascript
import WebSocket from 'ws';

const ws = new WebSocket(
  'wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/ws?sample_rate=16000&speech_model=universal-3-5-pro&mode=balanced',
  { headers: { authorization: process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY } },
);

ws.on('open', () => {
  // Feed PCM16 16kHz mono chunks here, 50–1000ms each.
  // Example: audioStream.on('data', (chunk) => ws.send(chunk));
});

ws.on('message', (raw) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(raw.toString());
  if (msg.type === 'Turn') {
    console.log(msg.end_of_turn ? `FINAL: ${msg.transcript}` : `partial: ${msg.transcript}`);
  }
});

function stop() {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'Terminate' })); // required!
}
```

**Python (`websockets`):**
```python
import asyncio, json, os, websockets

URL = "wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/ws?sample_rate=16000&speech_model=universal-3-5-pro&mode=balanced"

async def run(audio_source):
    """audio_source: async iterator yielding 50–1000ms PCM16 chunks at 16kHz mono."""
    async with websockets.connect(
        URL,
        additional_headers={"Authorization": os.environ["ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"]},
    ) as ws:
        async def send_audio():
            async for chunk in audio_source:
                await ws.send(chunk)
            await ws.send(json.dumps({"type": "Terminate"}))

        async def recv_loop():
            async for raw in ws:
                msg = json.loads(raw)
                if msg["type"] == "Turn":
                    tag = "FINAL" if msg["end_of_turn"] else "partial"
                    print(f"{tag}: {msg['transcript']}")
                elif msg["type"] == "Termination":
                    return

        await asyncio.gather(send_audio(), recv_loop())

# asyncio.run(run(my_audio_iterator()))
```

## 10. Voice Agent API (managed speech-in / speech-out)

Use this when the developer wants a complete spoken AI agent — not just transcription. Single WebSocket, audio in and audio out, with STT + LLM + TTS + turn detection + tool calling all managed by AssemblyAI.

**Endpoint:** `wss://agents.assemblyai.com/v1/ws`

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` — the Bearer prefix is **required** on this product (different from STT and LLM Gateway, which take the raw key). For browsers/mobile, mint a temp token instead and pass it as `?token=<token>`.

**Token endpoint (for browser/mobile clients):**
```bash
curl -s "https://agents.assemblyai.com/v1/token?expires_in_seconds=300&max_session_duration_seconds=8640"   -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"
# { "token": "..." }
```
- `expires_in_seconds`: 1–600 (controls how long the token can be redeemed for)
- `max_session_duration_seconds`: 60–10800 (caps the resulting session; defaults to the 3-hour max)
- Tokens are **single-use** per session — get a fresh one for every reconnect (including `session.resume`).

**Audio format:** PCM16 mono **24 kHz**, **base64-encoded inside JSON events** (not raw binary frames — this is different from realtime STT). ~50 ms chunks (2,400 bytes) is fine; the server buffers continuously, exact chunk size doesn't matter.

### Lifecycle (the events that matter)

1. Client connects, sends `session.update` immediately (don't wait for `session.ready`):
   ```json
   {
     "type": "session.update",
     "session": {
       "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
       "greeting": "Hi there! How can I help?",
       "input": {
         "format": { "encoding": "audio/pcm" },
         "keyterms": ["AssemblyAI", "Universal-3-5-Pro"],
         "turn_detection": {
           "vad_threshold": 0.5,
           "min_silence": 200,
           "max_silence": 1000,
           "interrupt_response": true
         }
       },
       "output": {
         "voice": "anna",
         "format": { "encoding": "audio/pcm" }
       },
       "tools": [ /* flat-schema tool defs, see step 5 */ ]
     }
   }
   ```
   Output `encoding` accepts `audio/pcm` (24 kHz, default), `audio/pcmu` (G.711 μ-law, 8 kHz), or `audio/pcma` (G.711 A-law, 8 kHz) — use the G.711 variants for telephony bridges (Twilio, etc.) so you don't have to resample.
2. Server replies with `session.ready` (capture `session_id` for `session.resume` if you reconnect within 30 s of a disconnect).
3. **Only after `session.ready`**, start realtime mic audio:
   ```json
   { "type": "input.audio", "audio": "<base64 PCM16 24kHz>" }
   ```
4. Server emits, in roughly this order, per turn:
   - `input.speech.started` / `input.speech.stopped` (VAD)
   - `transcript.user.delta` (partials) and `transcript.user` (final)
   - `reply.started`, `reply.audio` (multiple base64 PCM16 chunks — write directly into an output buffer at 24 kHz), `transcript.agent`, `reply.done`
   - **Field-name asymmetry:** `input.audio` carries audio in the `audio` field; `reply.audio` carries it in the `data` field. Easy to miss — copying `event["audio"]` from input handling will silently return nothing on output.
5. **Tool calls:** tool definitions in `session.tools` use a **flat** schema — *not* OpenAI's nested `{type: "function", function: {...}}` form:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "function",
     "name": "get_weather",
     "description": "Get the current weather for a city.",
     "parameters": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": { "location": { "type": "string" } },
       "required": ["location"]
     }
   }
   ```
   Server sends `tool.call` with `{call_id, name, arguments}`. Accumulate the result locally, then send `tool.result` with the matching `call_id` *after* `reply.done` fires. If `reply.done.status == "interrupted"` (user barge-in), discard pending tool results.
6. **Resume after disconnect:** within 30 s, reconnect with a *new* token and send `session.resume` carrying the previous `session_id` to keep conversation context. After 30 s, start a new session.

### Voices

Voice IDs are **exact strings** — invented or remembered values silently fail. **Call `GET https://agents.assemblyai.com/v1/voices` for the authoritative live list** rather than guessing (the catalog grows). Default: `anna`. A few current examples: US English `alba`, `jane`, `michael`; UK English `anna`, `charles`, `paul`, `vera`; language-specific (native accent, code-switches with English) `lola` (Spanish), `estelle` (French), `juergen` (German), `giovanni` (Italian), `rafael` (Portuguese).

If the developer needs a voice not returned by `/v1/voices`, *don't* substitute a similar-sounding name — say so and ask. Pre-Voice-Agent-API names like `claire`, `dawn`, `josh`, `grace`, `pete` are **no longer valid** and will be rejected at `session.update`.

### Playback gotcha

Don't sleep-schedule audio chunks. Write each `reply.audio` PCM directly to an OS audio buffer (e.g., `sounddevice.OutputStream.write()`) — the OS drains at exactly 24 kHz and absorbs network jitter. Sleep-based timing drifts and produces pops/gaps.

On `reply.done.status == "interrupted"`, flush the output buffer (e.g., `speaker.abort(); speaker.start()`) so the user doesn't hear stale agent speech.

### Quickstart pattern (Python sketch)

```python
# pip install websockets sounddevice numpy
import asyncio, base64, json, os
import sounddevice as sd
import websockets

URL = "wss://agents.assemblyai.com/v1/ws"
SAMPLE_RATE = 24_000

async def main():
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY']}"}
    async with websockets.connect(URL, additional_headers=headers) as ws:
        await ws.send(json.dumps({
            "type": "session.update",
            "session": {
                "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
                "greeting": "Hi! How can I help?",
                "output": {"voice": "anna"},
            },
        }))

        ready = asyncio.Event()
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        mic_q: asyncio.Queue = asyncio.Queue()

        def on_mic(indata, *_):
            if ready.is_set():
                loop.call_soon_threadsafe(mic_q.put_nowait, bytes(indata))

        async def pump_mic():
            while True:
                chunk = await mic_q.get()
                await ws.send(json.dumps({
                    "type": "input.audio",
                    "audio": base64.b64encode(chunk).decode(),
                }))

        with sd.InputStream(samplerate=SAMPLE_RATE, channels=1,
                            dtype="int16", callback=on_mic),              sd.OutputStream(samplerate=SAMPLE_RATE, channels=1,
                             dtype="int16") as speaker:
            asyncio.create_task(pump_mic())
            async for raw in ws:
                ev = json.loads(raw)
                if ev["type"] == "session.ready":
                    ready.set()
                elif ev["type"] == "reply.audio":
                    import numpy as np
                    speaker.write(np.frombuffer(base64.b64decode(ev["data"]), dtype=np.int16))
                elif ev["type"] == "reply.done" and ev.get("status") == "interrupted":
                    speaker.abort(); speaker.start()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### When to choose Voice Agent API vs realtime STT + your own LLM/TTS

- **Voice Agent API (Section 10):** end-to-end conversational agents, fastest to ship, AssemblyAI manages the pipeline. Use when "speech in, speech out" is the whole product.
- **realtime STT + framework (Section 11):** you need a specific LLM, a specific TTS provider, custom turn-detection logic, complex orchestration (LiveKit/Pipecat/Vapi/Vocode/Retell), or features the managed pipeline doesn't expose yet.

If they're not sure, ask: *do you want to choose your own LLM and TTS, or is a managed pipeline fine?* That single answer routes them.

---

## 11. Voice Agent Framework Configs (realtime STT + your own pipeline)

This section is for developers who are NOT using the Voice Agent API (Section 10) — they're wiring AssemblyAI realtime STT into LiveKit, Pipecat, Vapi, Vocode, Retell, or similar, and bringing their own LLM and TTS.

The defaults will not be good enough. Common tuning:

- **`mode`** — start here. Pick `min_latency`, `balanced`, or `max_accuracy`; it sets sensible turn-detection defaults so you usually don't need to hand-tune the silence bounds at all.
- **`agent_context`** — push your agent's latest spoken (TTS) reply here after each agent turn (via `UpdateConfiguration`). It biases the next user turn's transcription with what the agent just said — a big accuracy win for short replies ("yes", account numbers, spellings).
- **`keyterms_prompt`** — pass proper nouns, product names, and domain terms. For dynamic values (usernames, order IDs), update mid-session via `UpdateConfiguration`.
- **Turn silence bounds** — `min_turn_silence` and `max_turn_silence` (ms), only if `mode` isn't enough. Lower values fire end-of-turn faster but risk cutting speakers off. Higher values reduce false finalizations. Form-filling and dictation often want wider windows.
- **Multilingual** — Universal-3-5 Pro code-switches **natively** across its 18 languages with no config. To pin a single language you have two equivalent options: set `language_code` (e.g. `language_code=es`), or just say so in `prompt` (e.g. `"Transcribe in Spanish."`) — `language_code` is essentially a structured shortcut for the latter. To bias toward mixed-language audio, prompt something like `"Transcribe this. Mixed languages in their own characters."`. (There's no `end_of_turn_confidence_threshold` knob — end-of-turn confidence is binary on U3.5 Pro.)
- **Barge-in / false SpeechStarted** — ambient noise, TTS bleed-through, and PSTN echo can cause spurious `SpeechStarted` events. If the agent is interrupting itself, look here first. `voice_focus` can help suppress background noise server-side; framework-level knobs (e.g., LiveKit's `min_interruption_duration`) often complement, not replace, server-side tuning.
- **Phone audio** — 8 kHz mu-law (`pcm_mulaw` at 8000 Hz) should be sent as-is, not upsampled to 16 kHz. Upsampling degrades accuracy.

When the developer names one of these frameworks, ask about their specific turn-taking and interruption requirements before defaulting.

---

## 12. Browser Patterns

**Never put the API key in client code.**

### Pre-recorded — proxy upload + submit through your server

```javascript
// Next.js route handler (server)
export async function POST(request) {
  const incoming = await request.formData();
  const file = incoming.get('file'); // Blob

  const upload = await fetch('https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { authorization: process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY },
    body: file.stream(),
    duplex: 'half',
  });
  const { upload_url } = await upload.json();

  const submit = await fetch('https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY,
      'content-type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      audio_url: upload_url,
      speech_models: ['universal-3-5-pro', 'universal-2'],
    }),
  });
  return Response.json(await submit.json());
}
```

### realtime — server mints a temp token, client connects directly

```javascript
// Server
export async function GET() {
  const res = await fetch(
    'https://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/token?expires_in_seconds=60',
    { headers: { authorization: process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY } },
  );
  return Response.json(await res.json()); // { token }
}
```

```javascript
// Client
const { token } = await fetch('/api/aai-token').then((r) => r.json());
const ws = new WebSocket(
  `wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/ws?sample_rate=16000&speech_model=universal-3-5-pro&mode=balanced&token=${token}`,
);
ws.onmessage = (e) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(e.data);
  if (msg.type === 'Turn') console.log(msg.transcript, msg.end_of_turn);
};
```

### Capturing mic audio in the browser

`MediaRecorder` does not emit PCM16. You need an `AudioWorklet` (preferred) or `ScriptProcessorNode` to:
1. Capture raw Float32 samples.
2. Downsample to 16 kHz.
3. Convert Float32 → Int16.
4. Send each ~50 ms chunk as a binary WS frame.

Reference: [AssemblyAI realtime-transcription-browser-js-example](https://github.com/AssemblyAI/realtime-transcription-browser-js-example).

---

## 13. Not Supported / Out of Scope

If a developer asks for any of these, say so directly and propose the closest supported alternative. Do not improvise.

- **On-device / offline STT.** Cloud API only.
- **Voiceprint speaker recognition** — matching a voice to a person from an enrolled database of voiceprints. Not supported. `speaker_labels` only gives anonymous diarization (Speaker A, B, C). If you already know who's in the audio, **Speaker Identification** (`speech_understanding` with `speaker_type: "role" | "name"`, Section 3) can attribute turns to the roles/names you supply — but there's no enrollment/recognition of unknown speakers.
- **Standalone TTS.** Not an AssemblyAI product *as a separate API*. TTS is bundled into the Voice Agent API (Section 10) — if they need just-TTS, point them to a dedicated provider.
- **Voice activity detection as a standalone product.** VAD is internal to the realtime pipeline and surfaced via `SpeechStarted` / turn events, not exposed separately.

---

## 14. Error Handling

### REST (pre-recorded)

- **401** — Missing/invalid Authorization, disabled account, or insufficient balance. Double-check there's no `Bearer` prefix.
- **Transcript `status: "error"`** — Read the `error` field on `GET /v2/transcript/{id}`.
- **Retries** — Exponential backoff on 5xx. For 429, respect the `Retry-After` header.
- **Limits** — `/v2/upload` max 2.2 GB; `/v2/transcript` max 5 GB / 10 hr per file.
- **Scoping** — An API key can only transcribe files uploaded under the same project.

### realtime — handshake

- **HTTP 410** — The old `v2` realtime endpoint is deprecated. Upgrade to `/v3/ws`. This is an HTTP status on the upgrade request, not a WebSocket close code.

### realtime — WebSocket close codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `1008` | Unauthorized: missing/invalid Authorization or token |
| `3005` | Session cancelled (server-side error) |
| `3006` | Invalid message type / invalid JSON |
| `3007` | Audio chunk outside 50–1000 ms, or sent faster than real-time |
| `3008` | Session expired (3-hour cap) |
| `3009` | Too many concurrent sessions |

### realtime gotchas

- `speech_model` (realtime, singular string) vs `speech_models` (pre-recorded, plural array). Don't mix up.
- On U3.5 Pro realtime, `language_code` **is** honored (pins one of 18 languages); omit it for native code-switching, or steer language in `prompt` instead (e.g. `"Transcribe in Spanish."` — `language_code` is a shortcut for this). There is **no** `end_of_turn_confidence_threshold` knob — end-of-turn confidence is binary.
- Always send `{ "type": "Terminate" }` when finished. An abandoned session stays billable until the 3-hour cap (`3008`).
- Chunk size matters: frames outside 50–1000 ms will close the socket with `3007`.

## 15. Quick-Reference Gotchas

- No `Bearer` prefix on the Authorization header — *except* for the Voice Agent API (Section 10), which requires `Authorization: Bearer ...`.
- `speech_models` (pre-recorded) is **optional** — it defaults to `["universal-3-pro", "universal-2"]`, so pass `["universal-3-5-pro", "universal-2"]` explicitly to get the flagship. It's an **ordered fallback list** (plural **array**). Realtime differs: `speech_model` is a singular **string** (`universal-3-5-pro`) and **is required**. Plural array (pre-recorded, optional) vs singular string (realtime, required) is the most common mix-up.
- `universal-3-5-pro` covers 18 languages natively and auto-falls-back to Universal-2 for the rest — no extra config for multilingual audio.
- `prompt` is flexible natural-language guidance on U3.5 Pro (both pre-recorded and realtime): describe the audio and/or steer behavior — e.g. `"Transcribe in Spanish."` to set the language, or `"Transcribe this. Mixed languages in their own characters."` for code-switching. `language_code` is a structured shortcut for the language case.
- `keyterms_prompt` caps differ: up to **1,000** phrases pre-recorded (≤6 words each) vs **100** terms realtime vs **2,048 chars total** sync (Section 6.1).
- `/v2/upload` takes **raw binary**, not multipart.
- Webhook handlers must return 2xx in ≤10 seconds.
- Local webhook development needs a public tunnel (ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel).
- Browser code never holds the API key. Proxy uploads, or mint temp tokens for realtime.
- Always `Terminate` realtime sessions.
- Don't use `auto_chapters`, `summarization`, `summary_model`, `summary_type`. Use LLM Gateway.
- Medical mode is `domain: "medical-v1"` (pre-recorded body param / realtime query param). The legacy `medical_mode` flag is **not** the right name.
- LLM Gateway model IDs are exact and versioned (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-5.2`, `gemini-2.5-pro`). Shorthand like `claude-sonnet-4` is invalid.
- Phone audio stays at native 8 kHz mu-law (`encoding=pcm_mulaw`) — don't upsample.
- EU customers use `api.eu.assemblyai.com`, `streaming.eu.assemblyai.com`, and `llm-gateway.eu.assemblyai.com`. The default realtime host (`streaming.assemblyai.com`) is **Edge Routing**, not US-pinned — use `streaming.us.assemblyai.com` if you need data residency guarantees on the US side.
- Speech-model values are **raw strings** in the SDKs (`"universal-3-5-pro"`, `"universal-2"`, `"universal-3-pro"`). Enum aliases like `aai.SpeechModel.universal_3_5_pro` do **not** exist — agents that hallucinate them produce code that imports cleanly and fails at runtime.
- LeMUR has fully sunset (2026-03-31). Don't generate code that calls LeMUR endpoints or passes `transcript_ids` to a chat-completions API — use LLM Gateway with the transcript text in `messages` instead.
