# Backlog

Everything known and not done: work deliberately deferred, defects found and
left, behaviour nobody has tested. Every entry here is outstanding — if it has
shipped, it has moved to DECISIONS.md, and if it is about how to operate the
thing, it is in AGENTS.md.

Ordered roughly by size: the substantial pieces first, then individual defects.

The neighbours worth knowing about. **FEATURES.md** is the roadmap: features
that are wanted, at a paragraph each, which is a different question from work
that is specified and pending. One of them large enough to need a design gets a
file of its own, and that file is where it lives while it is being designed and
built, until it ships and whatever survives moves to DECISIONS.md.
**DECISIONS.md** holds what was built and why, including the choices that were
considered and declined — several of which read like missing features until you
find the reasoning.

## Two things that ship unbounded, both from channels being permanent

Channels themselves survive a restart — `9761d72`, 2026-08-10 — and this entry
used to say the opposite for a day after that shipped, which is worth a moment
of distrust for anything else here that has not been re-read lately. What
follows is what is actually outstanding.

- **Home grows without limit.** `invitesFor` and `rejoinableFor` partition
  channels into "invited, never entered" and "everything else you belong to".
  Nothing ever removes a channel from the second list, so it accumulates every
  channel you have ever been in, for ever. Sorting by presence and recent
  activity is done; bounding the list is not — it wants archiving, or leaving,
  to be something a person can actually do.
- **The tick loop walks every channel ever created**, every 500ms, as do
  `invitesFor`, `rejoinableFor` and `channelsFor`. It wants an active set — the
  channels with a live floor claim, playing playback, an active recording or a
  pending disconnect — and lazy residency for the rest.

---

## Presence follows the websocket, not the room

**Status:** not started. This is what survives the 2026-08 backgrounding
investigation, which is otherwise closed — see DECISIONS.md for what that
settled and how to instrument a phone if it ever needs doing again.

Presence is derived from the app's websocket; participation is what happens in
the LiveKit room. These can disagree for a long time in either direction, and
every symptom that has come of it — a ghost showing as Present, a channel
invisible to somebody who is in it, a run of empty-to-occupied flaps that are a
network artefact — has been patched at its own site rather than at the cause.

Presence probably ought to follow room membership, which is exactly "speaking
or hearing". The work is not small: the five-minute push quiet window, the
disconnect grace, and the eviction path all read from the socket today.

---

## Android has never been built or run

**Status:** not started. The spec asks for it; nothing has been done about it.

> React Native, targeting both iOS and Android from a single codebase.

`app.json` carries Android configuration from the scaffold, and the icons are
still Expo's defaults. There is no `android/` directory, no build has ever been
attempted, and no line of this has run on Android hardware or an emulator.

### What makes it more than a build step

Every hard problem in this project has been an iOS problem, and each was solved
against iOS's rules:

- **Background audio** was chased for two days through `UIBackgroundModes`,
  AVAudioSession ownership and CallKit (see DECISIONS.md). Android's
  foreground-service model is different in every particular, and the work does
  not transfer.
- **The audio channel** is started explicitly through
  `@livekit/react-native`'s `AudioSession`, whose behaviour differs by
  platform — `AndroidAudioTypeOptions` exists precisely because the two need
  configuring differently.
- **Export** hands a file to `expo-sharing`, which resolves to a different
  system sheet with different expectations about file URIs.
- **The dev loop** is `expo run:ios` against a paired device. Nothing equivalent
  is set up, and EAS was deliberately deferred until Android arrived — which is
  now.

So this is not "flip a target and rebuild". Expect the platform-specific parts
to need doing twice, and expect the second time to surface assumptions the
first one baked in.

### Sequence when picked up

1. `npx expo prebuild --platform android`, and confirm the WebRTC and
   file-system config plugins produce a working build at all.
2. Get a channel running between an Android device and an iPhone, which is the
   first real test of whether the media layer is as portable as assumed.
3. Only then background audio, where the work genuinely diverges.

---

## Notifications do not ring — they are alerts

**Status:** the alert shipped 2026-08-10 (see DECISIONS.md). This is what was
deliberately left out of it.

A notification arrives, sits on the lock screen, and opens the app into the
channel when tapped. What it does not do is behave like an incoming call:
there is no ringing, no answering from the lock screen, no full-screen incoming
UI, and nothing wakes the app before the tap.

### What the larger version needs

- **PushKit** to wake a closed app, which in turn requires **CallKit** — Apple
  requires a PushKit VoIP push to report an incoming call, and will terminate
  an app that takes one without doing so. Note CallKit was ruled out for
  background *audio* (see DECISIONS.md); this is the other thing it is for, and
  here it would be the right tool.
- `voip` in `UIBackgroundModes`, removed before the first TestFlight build
  because it did nothing, becomes load bearing again.
- A second delivery path in `push.ts`: a VoIP push is a different `apns-push-type`
  against a different topic (`<bundle id>.voip`) and a different device token,
  so `Pusher` gains a method rather than a caller.

The alert covers most of the value and none of this is undone by adding it —
the same server-side events would drive both.

### Smaller things left on the table

- **Time Sensitive delivery.** `interruption-level: 'time-sensitive'` would let
  a notification break through a Focus mode, which suits a live conversation.
  It needs the `com.apple.developer.usernotifications.time-sensitive`
  entitlement, so it is a trip through the developer portal rather than a code
  change.
- **Nothing is notified but these two events.** A contact request, a request
  accepted, or somebody inviting you into a channel you are already a member of
  all still reach you in-app only.
- **Android has no delivery at all.** `device_tokens` carries a `platform`
  column and accepts `'android'`, but no FCM sender exists — see the Android
  section above, where this is one item among many.

## Two-party consent has not been reviewed

**Status:** unanswered. A gate on letting anyone outside this machine record.

The spec raises it and defers it (§Recording, Consent indicator):

> a visual indicator provides notice but may not by itself satisfy legal
> consent requirements in all jurisdictions with two-party consent laws for
> recorded calls — this should be reviewed against applicable law before
> shipping, independent of the in-app UI.

That review has not happened. It is a legal question rather than a code one, so
no amount of implementation settles it — but it constrains what may ship, and
it is cheaper to answer before there are recordings of other people than after.

### What exists today

- A persistent red dot and "Recording" label in the Channel view, visible to
  both parties whenever capture is running.
- Either party may stop the recording at any time, except the silenced party
  during an active claim.
- A silenced speaker is told explicitly that they are still being captured.
- Recording is never automatic; someone has to start it.

So notice is given. Whether notice is *consent* is the open question, and in
several US states it is not.

### What makes it sharper than the spec anticipated

Capture is complete and continuous. A silenced speaker's audio is recorded in
full and stored as a stem; the floor is applied only when a recording is
encoded for export. That was a deliberate decision — the bucket is server-only
and stems never reach a client — but it means the system holds audio of someone
at a moment they were being prevented from being heard. Worth putting in front
of whoever reviews this, because it is not what "you are being recorded"
ordinarily implies.

### Likely shapes of an answer

- **Explicit consent at channel start**, from both parties, before recording is
  offered at all.
- **Consent per recording**, with the other party able to refuse.
- **Restrict by jurisdiction**, which requires knowing where users are.
- **Do not record at all** in the first release.

Each has a real product cost, which is why this wants deciding before it is
built around rather than after.

## SMS authentication — shelved indefinitely

**Status:** shelved 2026-08-04. Not scheduled.

Sign-in by phone number. The spec (§Accounts & Contacts) says identity is
established "via phone number or email plus a one-time verification code". Only
the email half exists.

### What is already built

Nothing about the auth machinery is email-specific. The one-time code lifecycle
— issue, hash, ten-minute expiry, five-attempt limit, single use, one-minute
resend throttle — lives in `server/src/accounts.ts` and is transport-agnostic.
Delivery sits behind the `Mailer` interface in `server/src/mail.ts`.

### What SMS would take

1. A `SmsSender` implementation alongside `SesMailer` — AWS SNS or Twilio.
2. Routing in `POST /auth/request-code`, which currently rejects any
   non-email identifier with `sms_unavailable`. The branch point already
   exists (`isEmailAddress`), so this is a dispatch, not a redesign.
3. Phone number normalisation to E.164. Absent today, and it matters:
   `+1 555 000 0001` and `+15550000001` would otherwise be different accounts,
   and contact search is an exact string match.
4. **Regulatory registration, which is the actual reason this is shelved.**
   US A2P SMS requires a registered originating number (10DLC) with a
   registered brand and campaign. Days to weeks of someone else's process,
   plus per-message and per-registration cost. No amount of code shortens it.

### Consequences of shelving, which are live now

- **Sign-in is email-only.** Accounts are created at code verification, so no
  account can ever hold a phone identifier.
- **Contact search by phone number therefore always fails.** Not because the
  search is broken — `findByIdentifier` would match one fine — but because no
  such account can exist. The UI still invites a phone number, which is
  misleading and worth changing to say email.
- The spec's "phone number or email" should be read as aspirational until this
  is picked up.

### Related decision

`AUTH_DEV_BYPASS` was introduced because phone identifiers had no transport,
making sign-in impossible rather than merely insecure. That justification is
gone: every identifier the app now supports has real delivery, and local
development can read codes off the server console by leaving `MAIL_FROM` unset
(`ConsoleMailer`). The bypass has since been deleted outright (`d0ffab3`).

## Per-speaker volume

**Status:** not started. Noted 2026-08-10.

A way to adjust each speaker's volume individually — manually, or automatically
by levelling the decibels so every participant lands at a comparable loudness.
People's microphones, distances and voices differ, and today the only remedy is
the device volume, which moves everyone at once.

Two shapes, not mutually exclusive:

- **Manual.** A per-participant level control, applied at the listener. The
  playback track already has exactly this (`setVolume` scaling samples in
  passing), so the precedent exists; the question is where speaker audio can be
  scaled — client-side per subscribed track is the likely place, since the
  server forwards packets rather than decoding them.
- **Automatic.** Normalise so all speakers sit at a similar level. That means
  measuring loudness per track and applying gain continuously — real DSP,
  either on each client or by putting the server into the media path it
  currently stays out of.

Manual is the smaller step and would likely be client-only. Note the recording
is unaffected either way if the gain is applied at the listener: stems capture
what was published, not what any one listener chose to hear.

## Interaction with phonecalls

There ought to be a proper co-existence with phone calls and equivalents, modeled after the
functionality of Facetime and Zoom channels.

---

## `HomeView.recordings` outlived its screen

The app shows recordings on the channel they were made in. The server still
sends the flat Home list, because build 20 and earlier render it and would
otherwise lose every recording at a deploy.

Once nobody is on 20, the field goes: `homeFor` stops calling `recordingsFor`,
and `RecordingView` leaves `HomeView` in `core/protocol.ts`. What must *not* go
with it is `recordingsFor` itself — the export and playback endpoints both read
it, and it is the one place the access rule is written down.

---

## The output picker is on probation

`ChannelSettingsView` raises iOS's own route picker — an `AVRoutePickerView`
via `AudioSession.showAudioRoutePicker`, not a control of ours, because nothing
in this stack tells JavaScript what outputs exist.

It is there to make a wrong route recoverable by whoever is hearing it rather
than by a release, and **it is expected to be removed.** The default should be
right on its own: `defaultToSpeaker` gives the loudspeaker rather than the
earpiece and yields to anything connected. If nobody reaches for the picker
after a few weeks of real use, that is the evidence that the default works and
this should come out — decided by the author on the day it was added, so that
the removal is a plan rather than a regret.

What would argue for keeping it: people using it to move audio somewhere iOS
would not have chosen — a Bluetooth speaker across a room, a car, an AirPlay
receiver. That is a want the default cannot infer.

---

## Known defects

Real, reproducible, and left alone. Resolved entries have been dropped — the
commits record them.

1. **"Audio connected" can be stale.** When the audio hook tears down, its
   cleanup cannot update state — the effect has already been cancelled — so the
   last status sticks and the screen asserts audio that is not there.
   `app/src/audio/useSessionAudio.ts`.
2. **The keyboard's submit key is labelled "Go" and sits in the corner.** The
   code field uses a number pad, which has no return key, so iOS floats a
   standalone key in the bottom-right — far from the fields, over empty space,
   reading "Go" while the button below says "Sign in". Either match the label or
   reconsider the number pad. `app/src/ui/components.tsx`.
3. **Timers derive from wall clock.** Every rule uses a caller-supplied `now`.
    The server is now the authority, which removed the device-drift problem, but
    a clock change on the server would still skew live countdowns. A monotonic
    source would be sounder.
4. **`bin/db` cannot show a JSON column.** `recordings.stems` and
    `floor_timeline` are JSON, and `-column` mode truncates them to the terminal
    width, so the values that matter most are the ones you cannot read. Working
    around it means `instr()` or `json_extract` in every query when you wanted
    to look at the value. A `--json` flag, or `.mode line` for wide results,
    would fix it. Noted 2026-08-09 while checking whether a media stem reached a
    recording. `bin/db`.
5. **`bin/db`'s remote one-shot has no busy timeout.** The interactive and local
    paths set `.timeout 2000`; the one that runs a single query over SSH does
    not, so it fails immediately against a locked database instead of waiting
    the way the others do. `bin/db`.
6. **`assertSilence` retries against absent participants twice a second, for as
    long as the floor is held.** The single loudest thing in the log — 470 in a
    day on 2026-08-10 — and it has never been chased.

    `assertSilence` iterates `state.participants`, which is channel
    *membership*, and calls `getParticipant(room, speaker)` for each. Membership
    is not room presence: a member who is not currently connected to LiveKit
    does not exist there, so the call throws `participant does not exist` rather
    than returning. The error handler then calls `note()`, which puts the
    speaker into `pendingSilence` — and the tick re-states everything in
    `pendingSilence` every 500 ms while a floor holder exists. So one absent
    member produces two failures a second per listener, indefinitely, and stops
    only when the floor is released.

    That is why the daily counts track how much talking happened rather than
    anything else, and why it survived the LiveKit Cloud → self-hosted move
    unchanged. **It is not a media-provider problem and should not be
    investigated as one.**

    The narrow fix is to treat "not in the room" the way "no published track" is
    already treated a few lines up — a `false` return rather than a throw, since
    both mean *cannot be acted on yet*, and only the `!applied && silenced`
    branch should re-note. The wider question is whether `assertSilence` should
    iterate room membership instead of channel membership at all, which is the
    same presence-vs-room-membership split already open under *Presence follows
    the websocket, not the room*.

    Nothing user-visible is known to break. Silencing works for everyone
    actually present, and an absent member has nothing to hear.

    **To find it in the logs:**

        ssh ubuntu@44.241.121.49 \
          'journalctl -u thefloor -o short-iso --no-pager' \
          | grep "media operation failed" | grep setSilenced

    Per-day counts, which is how the correlation with talking was established:

        … | cut -c1-10 | sort | uniq -c

    The signature that distinguishes this from an ordinary transient is the
    *rate*: bursts of 8–10 in the same second, sustained across consecutive
    seconds, rather than scattered singles. On 2026-08-14 it was 89 failures
    inside 24 distinct seconds.

        … | cut -c1-19 | uniq -c | sort -rn | head

    **To reproduce deliberately:** get two accounts into a channel, have one
    claim the floor, then force-quit the other client — or drop it from the
    network — without leaving the channel. The absent account stays in
    `state.participants`, and the log should start ticking twice a second within
    a couple of seconds and keep going until the floor is released.
    `server/src/channels.ts` (`assertSilence`, and the `pendingSilence` loop in
    `tick`), `server/src/media.ts` (`setSilenced`).

---

## Untested behaviour

No assertions exist for these. Ordered by how likely they are to be wrong.

1. **Two time-driven transitions in one tick.** If a claim's 3:00 expiry and the
   empty-channel 60s deadline fall in the same `TICK`, `reduce` handles floor
   expiry first, then the auto-end. Worth confirming that ordering is intended.
2. **A claim in the same instant the channel auto-ends.** The guard checks
   `status === 'active'`, but the interleaving of a tap against the 500ms tick
   is untested.
3. **Chained alternation with early voluntary releases.** The alternation test
   only exercises full 3:00 turns. A releases at 0:30 → B claims → B releases at
   0:10 → can A claim? (Should be yes: B was the last claimant.)
4. **Both parties leave, one re-enters after 30s, then leaves again.** Does the
   empty timer restart cleanly from the second departure, or carry a stale
   `emptySince`? Believed correct, untested.
5. **Recording paused, then the other party claims.** Resume is deliberately
   unrestricted, so a silenced party can resume but not re-pause. Verify that is
   not a control that looks broken.
6. **Self-mute across leave and re-entry.** `selfMuted` is never reset on
   `LEAVE`, so someone who leaves muted returns muted. Probably right; the spec
   does not say.
7. **`END` dispatched twice**, or `LEAVE` after `END`. Should be inert — the
   reducer returns early on non-active channels — but untested.
